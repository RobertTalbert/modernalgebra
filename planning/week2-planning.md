# MTH 350 Week 2 (Investigation 2) 

+ State the definition of *divides* in the context of integers; use the definition to decide if one integer divides another and to rephrase a division relationship. 
+ State the *Division Algorithm*; apply it to identify the quotient and remainder when dividing one integer by another. 
+ State the *Well-Ordering Principle*. 
+ Explain line-by-line the proof of the Division Algorithm. 
+ Define what it means for two integers to be congruent modulo n; use the definition to decide if two integers are congruent mod n and to rephrase a congruence relationship. 
+ State and apply Theorem 2.10. 
+ Prove properties of congruence mod n (such as in Activity 2.12). 




## 2A

Focus on divisibility definition and the Division Algorithm, setting up the tools needed to prove it and then starting a proof 

+ State the definition of *divides* in the context of integers; use the definition to decide if one integer divides another and to rephrase a division relationship. 
+ State the *Division Algorithm*; apply it to identify the quotient and remainder when dividing one integer by another. 
+ State the *Well-Ordering Principle*.
