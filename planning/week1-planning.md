# Planning for Week 1

## Tuesday 1/19

+ Welcome, small group introductions
+ What the course is about 
+ What to do right away
  + Read syllabus and calendar
  + Do the startup activity -- deadline Monday Jan 25 **required for a C or higher** 
    + Course questionnaire
    + Syllabus quiz
    + Grading system video and quiz
    + Campuswire
    + Scan + upload 
+ What to do after you've done that 
  + Daily Prep 1 -- what it is and how it's graded 
+ Rest of the time: Work on your startup activity -- set up separate breakout rooms for the different tasks, join a breakout room to get help; also a quiet room and a chatty room

## Thursday 1/21 

Basic: 
- State the contents of the sets of natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers and identify these sets by their symbols.
- State the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic.
- State the definition of an additive inverse of an integer.
- State the Ordering Axioms of the integers.

Advanced: 
- Use the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic to prove basic results about integers (such as in Activity 1.6).
- Use the Ordering Axioms to prove basic results about integers (such as in Theorem 1.7).

Daily Prep: 
- Activity at beginning -- use properties of integers to do math
- Read up on and state the different axioms, etc. 
- what is an axiom anyway? and what is a theorem? 

Class activities: 
- Comprehending definitions: Additive inverse (ACtivity 1.4) 
- Think about proofs from Activity 1.6, sketch a few others out (in groups using a Google Doc)
- Comprehending the Ordering Axioms (maybe polling) 

-- then save other activities for Weekly Practice 


**Class Outline** 

- First 10
  - Polling to recall concepts 
  - Questions from DP and groups
- Middle 55 
  - Minilecture on what this investigation is about: Identifying the core axioms, all else is proven from those axioms -- take as little on faith as possible, prove as much as we can. This relies on solid definitions. 
  - ACtivity in groups: Pros/cons of the different ways to define additive inverse (Google Doc in groups) 
  - Proof analysis from Activity 1.6
  - Groups: Do a proof of another part of Activity 1.6 
  - Proof analysis re: ordering axioms
- Last 10
  - Polling to wrap up, formative assessment -- how to interpret your polling results 
  - Google Form for reactions 
  - Slide to say what's next
