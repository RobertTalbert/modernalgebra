# Draft copy for W22 MTH 350 syllabus

## What MTH 350 is all about

Welcome to MTH 350. During this semester, we'll explore a subject that's both familiar and mysterious to most people: **algebra**. We will **discover why algebra works**, and then  see **how far we can bend the rules of algebra before they break**. 

When we say "discover", we really mean it! A real understanding of mathematical ideas doesn't come from listening to a lecture: It comes from doing mathematics. So in MTH 350, you'll be making sense of concepts and attempting proofs before class. Then you will present and discuss your ideas during class and polish up proofs of your discoveries both in and out of class. Our motto: The person doing the math is the person learning the math. 

This isn't easy! But MTH 350 is a safe space to make mistakes. We are committed to feedback loops: Trying something in good faith, even if it's not completely right; then getting trustworthy feedback from others and yourself; then using the feedback to try again and make things better. Eventually, if you really engage with this process, you will figure things out, really understand this weird subject we call algebra, and be much stronger in your ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms.

## Course goals

Catalog description: Algebraic properties of the integers and the development of the rational, real, and complex number systems as algebraic structures. Topics from modern algebra include rings, integral domains, fields, and ring isomorphisms. Further study of algebraic structures using congruence arithmetic and factorization in the ring of integers and polynomial rings.

Course level objectives: This course is a study of the foundations of "high school algebra" and the abstract structures that extend those foundations to other things. After successful completion of the course, you will be able to 

1. Communicate the topics of abstract algebra using accepted proof writing conventions, explanations, and correct mathematical notation and using effective oral communication.
2. Identify fundamental structures of abstract algebra including rings, fields, and integral domains.
3. Comprehend abstract definitions and theorem statements by building examples and non-examples of definitions, and drawing conclusions using definitions and theorems given mathematical information. 
4. Demonstrate problem solving skills in the context of abstract algebra topics through consideration of examples, pattern exploration, conjecture, proof construction, and generalization of results.
5. Analyze similarities and differences between algebraic structures including rings, fields, and integral domains. 

These overarching course objectives are broken down into more detail in this document. In addition to learning the content, I want you to: 

- Grow and succeed as a learner. 
- Improve your ability to identify patterns, form abstractions, make conjectures, and write proofs independently. 
- Learn to communicate complex mathematical ideas in a way that makes sense to a variety of audiences. 
- Gain a deep understanding of algebra and what it's really about. Most people view algebra as a set of weird symbol manipulation tricks. Boring! Algebra at its core is a powerful way of viewing the world around us. 

This course is subject to the GVSU policites listed at http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/. This Syllabus builds on this basic information. If you are looking for something that's not in the syllabus, check the policies website. 

This syllabus may (and probably will) be updated as the class unfolds and you provide feedback. All such changes will be run by you first and then announced clearly on Blackboard. 

## What will I be doing to learn, and when do I do it? 

Our class meetings are Tuesday/Thursday and will be in-person unless otherwise noted. If you cannot attend, check out the remote participation policy. 

Here is the work you'll do on a day-by-day basis. All times are in the Eastern time zone. 

Tuesday (1-2 hours): Turn in the Daily Prep assignment for Tuesday's class. Scan and upload your work to Blackboard, and volunteer to present. 
Do it: Thursday through Tuesday
Submit by: Tuesday 9am on Blackboard

Thursday (1-2 hours): Turn in the Daily Prep assignment for Thursday's class.  
Do it: Thursday-Tuesday
Submit by: Thursday 9am on Blackboard

Complete weekly homework and revisions (3-4 hours): Work on homework problems throughout the week and submit a revision of a previous homework problem. 
Do it: Throughout the week
Submit by: Thursday 11:59pm on Blackboard

You should also take 30 minutes after each class to consolidate your notes, work out parts of class work you didn't understand, and formulate questions to ask. You can ask those questions right away in drop-in hours or email, or with your working group. 

Due dates: We adopt a real-world policy on due dates in MTH 350, but this may not mean what you think. In the real world, due dates exist but they are rarely ironclad. Most of the time, they are there only as a device to motivate you to complete the task. But if you need more time to get the job done well, you email whoever set the deadline and ask if you can have some more time. This is usually not a big deal, but if it happens a lot, people will start asking you if everything is alright.

If you need an extension on a due date, email me and explain what you need, and it will mostly be fine. It helps if you propose a concrete new deadline (e.g. "I can get this to you by tomorrow at 11:59pm"). If you ask for lots of extensions, we’ll work together to find ways to help you keep up. Note that you may not get timely feedback if you need an extension on something.

If you have significant extenuating circumstances that cause you to miss multiple assignments, please come to drop-in hours to discuss broader accommodations. I’ll be flexible, but it helps to know what you need so that I can find the best way to help.

One important exception: Daily preps are due before class so that you’re primed and ready to think about others’ ideas, and so that I can choose presenters. For that reason, daily preps absolutely must be done before class. If you need a little more time than the standard deadline (9am), let me know. 

## What assessments will there be? 

Click each link below for details. 

- Daily Preparation and Research Notebook (scan and upload to Blackboard by 9am before each class): Before each class, you will do some practice with new concepts, attempt new problems, and make notes, and volunteer to present your work in class. 
- Presentations and Class Journal (daily in class): I will ask you to share your work with the class. You can do this in two ways: Presenting in class, and publishing your work in the Class Journal. 
- Homework (submit on Blackboard every Thursday by 11:59pm): You will write professional solutions to a subset of the Daily Prep problems, based on your prep work, presentations, and discussions. 
- Check-ins (twice, around weeks 5 and 10): Twice this semester, I will ask you to reflect on your progress and compare it to the criteria for grades in our course. To do this, you will write a reflection about your work in the class, your understanding, and your goals for the rest of class. The goal is to ensure that we both agree on where you are, and what you need to do to succeed in class. Details will be given in class and posted on Blackboard.
- Portfoli (submit on Blackboard at the end of the final exam period): Your final exam in this class is to submit your portfolio: A collection of your work that showcases your development as a mathematician and learner in this class.

All assignments will be submitted on Blackboard. I will give you feedback via Blackboard or your GVSU email.
To find feedback on Blackboard: Click “Check my grades & feedback” in our MTH 350 course. Click on the assignment name to view your submission. There will be feedback either on your submitted document or in the “Feedback to Learner” area, often both. 

About MTH 350 Problems 
A "problem" by definition is a question that does not have an obvious solution. Questions with obvious solutions are "exercises". Solving real problems is difficult and requires time, creativity, and persistence -- and the ability to identify and learn from missteps and errors. 

In MTH 350, our focus is on problems that are interesting and deep. You can expect to spend a lot of time and energy on the problems we solve. But, we will do it in a structured way similar to the process professional mathematicians use: 




## How do I earn a grade? 

All meaningful human learning takes place through feedback loops: We try stuff, take stock of what went well and what needs improvement, get feedback, and then use the feedback to try again with improvements. I want you to focus exclusively on learning and growth in MTH 350 and not on your grade. Insofar as we must use grades at all, I strongly believe that they should reflect how well you eventually understand each important concept in the class. 

There are two main things to do in MTH 350: Show an understanding of algebraic ideas, and engage with with class. Your job during the semester is to create a body of work that gives concrete evidence of your growth and accomplishments in these areas. The table below lists some examples, some of which are essential, of things you can do toward this goal. Throughout the semester I will give you detailed feedback on assignments (particularly homework) that engages you in a feedback loop: What you are doing well, and what you should work on. 

To earn an A
To earn a B
To earn a C

There is no description for a D or F, because these grades represent a fundamental breakdown of expectations. A “D” represents a meaningful but unsuccessful attempt at earning a C or above. An “F” represents such a severe lack of engagement, effort, or understanding that there is no evidence of meaningful progress.

Individual assignments will not have grades attached to them. You will get 

Check-in meetings: Several times during the semester, I’ll ask you to compare your work to the criteria above and write a brief description of your current progress. We will discuss and agree on where your current grade is, and make a plan for how to achieve your goals.

Portfolio: At the end of the semester, you will make the case that you’ve earned one of these grades. The Portfolio is the main way that you will do this: First, by including a narrative description of how you have met the criteria for a grade. Second, by including evidence (e.g. proofs, presentations, etc.) that supports your description.

Does this mean that you'll get whatever course grade you ask for? No. If you state that you deserve an "A" in the course but don't have sufficient evidence to support it, we'll have a discussion about what you have earned, but it won't be an A without evidence. 

Earning an A in MTH 350 is not easy. You might find it's harder to get an A here than in a course with a traditional exams/points approach, because you can't mask over poor work in one area with excellent work in another and have it average out. An A requires consistent growth and eventual excellence in all areas of the course, no exceptions! However, I am on your side --- your personal consultant and coach whose main priority is your success. We will discuss these grade descriptions as a class and may make modifications to them if needed. Please know that I have your interests at heart and will act with professional judgment. In turn, I ask you to trust me: I am not trying to “trick” you or otherwise catch you on technicalities.


## Daily Preparation 

Description and purpose: Daily Prep assignments are where you have first contact with new ideas and create first attempts at solutions to problems. On Blackboard, I will post a list of the current problems on which we are working. Your goal is to read and solve – or make as much progress as possible – on these problems before the next class. This will ensure that you are ready to take an active part in our class presentations and discussions. The research notebook is a place to keep and organize your notes on all of these problems.

Research notebook: You will need a way to keep daily handwritten notes organized. I suggest a paper notebook or binder that is dedicated just to MTH 350, or using a note-taking app such as Microsoft OneNote on a computer or tablet. (I do not recommend typing your notes; this puts too much friction between having a thought and recording it.) Keep all of your daily prep work together, dated and ordered, so that it’s easy to find.

What to do: Look up th reading and problems on Blackboard. Then: 

- Do the reading and play with new ideas: Read the text carefully, for full understanding. If there are new definitions or axioms, first create examples and non-examples to help you understand them.
- For each problem that is listed: 
    - Start a new page in your research notebook. Label it with the full problem number, write out the full problem statement, and the date. 
    - Work to solve the problem or construct the proof. This is just a first draft. The goal is to fully understand the ideas, but you do not need to have something that looks publication-ready (that's what homework is for). However, aim to be clear and thorough, and try to create a complete proof with no gaps or skipped parts. If there are mistakes, that's OK. 
    - In fact, keep your mistakes. Do not erase or delete errors! Just clearly indicate them. Mistakes are extremely useful in mathematics. Keep them around -- "quarantine" them in a box or with an "X" or a different color if you like, but make sure you make a note to yourself about why you think it's a mistake, and keep it readable for later analysis.  
- Collaboration is strongly encouraged on Daily Prep. Give specific credit next to ideas and key insights.  See Academic Integrity and Collaboration for more. 
- Time commitment: Daily Prep work should consume up to 50% of your total out-of-class time. In a 3-credit college class this amounts to about 1-2 hours per Daily Prep, twice a week. You can take more time if you want; but if you are consistently spending more than 2 hours per Daily Prep, please let me know because there are probably adjustments we can make to your process that will help. 
- You start at least 24 hours before Daily Prep is due. 

Due date and volunteering to present: Scan and upload your Daily Prep work to Blackboard no later than 9:00am on class day. In the "Comments" box, indicate which problems (if any) you would be willing to present in class. 

Progress: Think of Daily Prep as a completion and effort assignment. Make a genuine effort to understand and thoroughly solve the required problems -- but mistakes are OK and expected. The goal is to be prepared. Incorrect but well-thought-out answers are fine. I may occasionally ask to see your research notebook, to ensure it is complete and organized.


## Presentations and the Class Journal

Description and purpose: The sharing of your ideas is the heart of this course. We do this in two ways: presenting in class, and publishing in our class journal. 

Presentation in class: I will ask you to present your work on some of the Daily Prep questions during class. Your ideas will start mathematical discussions. Your goal is to have a complete and correct solution, but it is the goal that matters, not the actual solution.

When you submit your daily prep work (see Daily Prep), indicate which problems you are willing to present in class. I will post a list of presenters at the start of class. If you volunteered, be ready to present. I will not select presenters based on correctness, rather, I will focus on those whose voices have been heard less (or less recently). I may ask multiple students to present, if their solutions are different or illustrate interesting issues. You won’t present every time you volunteer.

The goal of a presentation is to communicate your understanding of an idea in a helpful way, and to create discussions that help everyone understand it better. Aim to be correct, but the goal is the important part, not actually being correct. Mistakes and the discussions following them are some of the most valuable ways for everyone to learn!

Publishing in the Class Journal: The Class Journal is a community document where we collaboratively make professionally written solutions to every problem we do. I will post a list of all problems that are open for Class Journal submissions.

Claiming problems: You may “claim” an open problem by emailing me. I will add your name and the date on the list of problems. You then have 1 week to submit an excellent homework-quality solution. You may only have one problem claimed at a time. Just like with presentations, if more than one person asks to claim a problem at the same time, I will choose based on who has completed fewer presentations and journals.

Review process: I will review your submission and choose whether to accept it. Journal problems must be fully correct and illustrate excellent communication. To achieve this, I might ask you to make revisions before accepting your work.

Being a reviewer: If you’ve demonstrated excellent work in creating proofs, I may ask you to become a reviewer (taking over the role described in “Review process” above). This is an honor! It’s also a great way to demonstrate your deep understanding of geometric ideas.



## Homework

I will assign homework every week, consisting of practice exercises (to build your fluency with the week's concepts) and 1-2 problems from Daily Prep and class work. These are significant assignments that form the major part of your out-of-class work beyond daily prep. Expect to spend at least half of your out-of-class time, about 3-4 hours per week, on homework. You should spend this time in frequent, regular, and focused blocks --- I recommend 30-60 minutes per day, preferably the same time every day. 

What to do: Practice exercises are for you, and answers to these will be posted when the homework is assigned. You should work the practice exercises to build your skills, but do not turn these in; instead, check your answers and ask questions about things you don't understand. For the problems to solve: Write correct, complete, convincing, and clear solutions (these are almost always proofs) for the problems that are assigned. This should be based on your own Daily Prep work and our class presentations and discussion. You will also sometimes write short essays on related topics.

Due date: Homework is due each Thursday at 11:59pm on Blackboard. 

Template and typing: Homeworks must be typed using LaTeX. I will post Overleaf templates on Blackboard.

Objectives and focus: Read the MTH 350 Homework Objectives. Your work should meet the objectives listed there. Each homework assignment will list some specific "focus" objectives. These will help you practice different aspects of proof-writing and communication throughout the semester.

Feedback and Progress: Homework is one of the main ways to show how you’ve earned your desired grade. I will give you detailed feedback on each assignment to help you understand your progress. See the Homework Objectives document for details.

Collaboration: Each homework set will have specific instructions about collaboration. See “Academic Integrity” for more details. You may always talk with me (Talbert) about homework and ask specific questions. However, since you can revise homework problems (see below) I typically do not look over student work to pre-evalate it before it's submitted; that's what the revision process is for. 

Revisions
You may revise and resubmit work on one homework problem (not homework set) each week. For the purposes of revision, a "week" is defined to start at 12:01am on Sunday and end at 11:59pm the following Saturday. 

Each revision must include a short reflection that summarizes the important items that caused issues on the previous sumission, along with a specific explanation of what you did to improve your understanding and how you have demonstrated that improvement in this revision. Click here for examples of good and not-as-good reflections on work. 

The reflection is essential in each revision. Without the reflection, the revision is incomplete and will not be reviewed. Avoid saying “it was just a small mistake” or “I made a bunch of silly mistakes.” If your progress didn’t meet the objectives, there was a major reason: What was it? In math, even “small” things can make a major difference in logic and correctness. 

You may revise the same problem more than once in a week with m permission. 

Since you are only allowed one revision per week, you should commit to revising a proble every week. Most students will need to do revisions on homework problems; waiting until late in the semester will cause you to run out of time to revise all you need to revise. I highly recommend consulting with me to make sure you understand my feedback before you submit a revision. 


## Portfolio

Your portfolio in MTH 350 is a collection of your best work that shows how you have grown as a mathematician and learner and attained mastery of algebraic ideas from day 1 to the end of the semester. You will use your portfolio to make a convincing case that you have met the criteria for a course grade. 

Due date: Your portfolio is due at the end of the final exam period for your section, uploaded to Blackboard. 

What should be in the portfolio? I’ll post more specific instructions later in the semester. For now, you should know that the portfolio will include:
Some short essays that give you a chance to showcase specific aspects of your work in class. These prompts will be posted later in the semester.
A selection of completed proofs that you submitted throughout the semester (for homework, check-in meetings, and class journals) that show how you have met various criteria.
Other artifacts that show how you’ve met criteria for a grade. For example: If you gave a presentation that didn’t become a homework proof, but it helps show how you’ve met grade criteria, you can include it in the portfolio. Many other things are possible. In the end, anything that supports your argument for how you’ve earned a grade can be used in the portfolio. 
The grade you believe you've earned: A guided reflection that describes which grade you are aiming to earn, and how your portfolio shows that you’ve met the criteria for that grade.

Revisions: You can revise any proofs or other artifacts another time before including them in the portfolio. Your goal is to show how you’ve met the criteria for each grade by the end of the semester. If something confused you early on, but you’ve figured it out now -- show me!

How your portfolio is used to determine your grade: When you submit your portfolio, I will read everything in it --- the artifacts you include and your reflections. If you make a convincing case that you've earned a particular grade, you'll earn that grade. 

If you underestimate your grade in the portfolio (i.e. you judge yourself too harshly) then I may assign a higher grade, based on your evidence and also what I have seen from your work. If you overestimate your grade (i.e. you suggest a higher grade than the evidence supports) then we will discuss it in our check-in meetings, and I will probably ask for an additional check-in meeting to discuss the grade criteria and arrive at a grade we can both agree on. 

Under no circumstances will I assign a grade lower than what you suggest for yourself, without discussing it with you first! Through our check-in meetings and any discussion you want to have in between those, there should be no surprises. 


## Policies 

Attendance and absences: Attendance in this class is crucial for success. As a community of learners, we will be presenting ideas every day and engaging in live discussions of your work. If you're absent, it's impossible to participate in this community fully. 

However, we've learned over the last two years how unpredictable life can be, so I do not take attendance and there is no "attendance grade". There will be sign-in sheets at each meeting, but these are for contact-tracing purposes and to help me know when a student has a pattern of absences. Otherwise, it's up to you to make decisions about attendance based on your situation, and I trust and honor those decisions. 

If you do miss a class, you are responsible for all material and announcements. The Class Page will have links to materials, photos from the board, and other items. You're expected to take the initiative to catch up once you are able. 

Remote participation: Please plan to attend class meetings in-person unless you are ill or in quarantine. If the latter happens, you can participate remotely by emailing me first to let me know your situation; I will then set up a camera 

Special accommodations: If you are in need of accommodations due to a learning, physical, or other disability you must present a memo to me from Disability Support Resources (DSR), indicating the existence of a disability and the suggested reasonable accommodations. If you have not already done so, please contact the Disability Support Resources office (215 CON) by calling 331-2490 or email to dsrgvsu@gvsu.edu. Please note that I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until you have provided I a copy of the DSR issued memo. All discussions will remain confidential.

If you have a physical disability and think you will need assistance evacuating this classroom and/or building in an emergency situation, please make me aware so I can develop a plan to assist you.

Food and drink: This class meets in the middle of the day when you might normally eat lunch. GVSU's face covering policy https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm states in part that "In other public indoor locations [like classrooms], face coverings may be removed briefly for eating and drinking." I encourage you to eat before or after class so that you can keep your mask on the whole time; but if your class meeting is the only time you have to eat, it's fine to do so as long as your mask stays on while you are not actively eating. 

Basic needs: If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit [Replenish](https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/), a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources. 

Technology expectations: You will regularly type up your proofs using LaTeX and Overleaf. We will also use various Google products (particularly Google Docs, Jamboard, and your GVSU Google Drive) to access documents and other shared files. You are expected to have basic fluency with these. If you need help with any of these (especially LaTeX), just ask someone in the class or ask me, or look for help online. No other technology use is planned. However, if the class is forced to move online or if you need to participate remotely, be sure you have read and understood GVSU's basic technology requirements for students. 

Tech support: If you encounter issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help: 

+ *For help with Blackboard*: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/. 
+ *For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing*: Email the GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/. 
+ *For specific help with your computer*: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or computer store.  

Please note that **I (Prof. Talbert) am not able to provide student tech support** as I do not have access to your accounts or knowledge of your hardware. Questions about how to use software such as Overleaf are welcome; but you might get a quicker response if you ask your working group. 

Expectations for staying current: I will post general course announcements twice a week, on Sundays and Wednesdays. Messages that need to be sent immediately will be posted as needed. These will be pushed to your GVSU email.  Additionally, all date-sensitive information like due dates will be posted to the class Google Calendar, which is linked in the Blackboard sidebar. If there is ever an apparent date conflict on a course document, assume that the Google Calendar is right. You are expected to check Blackboard and your email, at least once a day (twice is better) to be aware of announcements, and check the calendar regularly to stay current with due dates. 

Availability and response policy: You can ask a question about anything at any time. Email is the preferred medium, but I also welcome visits during drop-in hours; appointments are also available. If you email between 6:00am and 4:00pm on a weekday, I'll respond on the same day. If you email after 4:00pm on a weekday, I'll respond the following day. If you email late Friday or on a weekend, I'll respond by Monday morning. Sometimes it’s easier to talk in person than via email, so I may ask you to meet with me during drop-in hours rather than answering directly in an email.

## Academic Integrity and Collaboration 

This class is a community of learners. We are working together to develop individual deep understanding of the concepts of abstract algebra. So, collaboration is deeply important here and much of your work will be done with others. But individual mastery is just as important, so some portions of your work must be done individually. Balancing collaboration with individual mastery is not easy, so here are the boundaries for our class. 

This course is subject to the GVSU course policies and the GVSU student code. This document establishes guidelines and expands and clarifies these policies with respect to all work done in MTH 331 this semester. Be sure to read it carefully and honor it fully.

The student code defines academic misconduct as any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination. This includes cheating, collusion, dual submission, falsification, and plagiarism.

With whom can I collaborate? In MTH 350, collaboration is permitted and encouraged in most cases. You'll be assigned to a working group early in the semester, and your working group is a key resource for making sense of new ideas. However: You may only collaborate with students currently enrolled in your section of MTH 350. 

How do I acknowledge collaboration? If you collaborate with someone in your work, just clearly state their name(s) and the problems where you collaborated. If you follow the instructions in this syllabus, this will not hurt your grade. 

Specific academic honesty parameters: The following are guidelines for avoiding academic misconduct in assignments. This list is intended to be helpful but it is not exhaustive. If you are unsure about whether some form of assistance you are seeking is within the rules, you should always ask first. And, if you are tempted to work outside the rules, don't! Academic misconduct is relatively easy to detect and the consequences are grave. Talk to me (Talbert) first so we can figure out a path for you and your work that helps you learn and grow. 

- Your working group: In general, you may work ith your working group on all assignments as long as you acknowledge them (see above) and follow the rest of the requirements listed below. 
- Collaborative homework problems: On every homework problem, every step of every solution must be one that you understand yourself and that you have generated by thinking and playing with the problem. You are allowed to collaborate on big ideas and hints with classmates (including but not limited to your working group). But you must always write your solutions independently and be prepared to defend your solutions to me (Talbert) and others. All collaboration on homework problems should occur when your collaborators are at roughly the same stage of the problem solution as yourself. For example, you haven't started problem 3 on a homework set and you ask a friend who has already completed it to walk you through the solution, this is academic misconduct because the resulting work is not one you have generated by thinking and playing with the problem. Also, the converse is true --- if you have completed problem 3 on a homework set and a friend who hasn't started it asks you for the solution, giving that help counts as academic misconduct. 
- Independent homework problems: Some homework problems are specifically labeled "Individual only", so as not to allow collaboration. This is to help ensure your development of independent skill. For those problems, the only help you can receive is from me (Talbert). 
- Outside resources in general: On all work, unless directly stated otherwise, the only resources you may use are your textbook and your class notes. You are not permitted to use, or even look for, completed solutions to problems in other texts or resources. In particular use of internet resources and other textbooks is strictly off limits, including homework and daily prep assignments. Be warned: Many of our problems and exercises are somewhat commonly found online or in other books. If you see a solution posted or printed elsewhere then it makes it impossible to write a solution you have generated by thinking and playing with the problem. 
- Copying: Copying a solution, or any part of a solution, from any source (friend, Internet, book, etc.) in any setting, constitutes academic misconduct. Also, allowing a friend to copy your work constitutes academic misconduct on your part. 
- Past students and solution sharing sites (e.g. Chegg): On any assignment, basing your work on the efforts of another student who previously completed this course, or one like it, is considered academic misconduct. Use of any shared or solicited materials, including those posted on Chegg or similar sites, is academic misconduct. Class materials may not be shared beyond other students in this class, including posting your solutions on Chegg or elsewhere.
- Other instructors, the Math Center, and the PCS: You may not seek the help of an instructor or tutor (other than me) unless you first discuss this with me in advance. If you do not verify that this is acceptable before seeking help, it will be considered academic misconduct. 

Please note, getting help on technology (including LaTeX), how to give a good oral presentation, or other aspects of the course that aren't directly related to mathematics is always OK, and you can get that help from anywhere you like. 

Consequences of academic dishonesty: Evidence of dishonest behavior on any assignment will result, at a minimum, in not being able to use that work as evidence in your grade check-ins and final portfolio. In severe cases, the minimum penalty will be failure of the course. Peers who willingly assist others in acts of academic misconduct are equally guilty, and will suffer similar penalties. In all cases, the guidelines established in the GVSU catalog and GVSU student code will be followed. I reserve the right to discuss the nature and origins of any assignment with any student before assessing it.

Why none of this should be a problem: Remember my top commitment in this course is to help you succeed in learning and growing. All aspects of the course are optimized to help you do just this. There are acceptable levels of collaboration; lots of support from your classmates and from me as you work; and a robust system of revision and resubmission on most work. If you fully engage with the process in MTH 350, you will have to work hard and may encounter short-term failures, but eventually you will make sense of the material and succeed in an honest and satisfying way. 

I am very happy to work with you to give guidance on your work. I will never do your work for you (remember the motto) but I am generous with hints and feedback that will help you come to a good solution that is truly yours. 

We are a community of learners in MTH 350. If you tap into that community within the above guidelines and commit to the feedback loop process, you'll succeed!
