# Specs grading not SBG

To earn a grade, students have to demonstrate mastery in three different dimensions: 

- Foundational skills
- Applications and extensions
- Engagement and community

Set these up as bundles. Each bundle has 3 levels.  

## Foundational skills bundle

Mastery attained by doing work on 

- Basic individual problems (including some theorem activities) 
- Team problems 
- Definition activities 
- Review package at beginning 


| Level | General idea of work | 
| ----  | -------------------- | 
|  3    | High rate of M/E on problems of both kinds with a lot of E's; Pass on 90% of definition activities; Pass on review package | 
|  2    | High rate of M/E on problems of both kinds; Pass on 80% of definition activities; Pass on review package | 
|  1    | Medium level of M/E on problems; Pass on 70% of definition activities; Pass on review package | 


## Application/extension bundle

Mastery attained by doing work on 

- Advanced individual problems 
- Proof portfolio (starred problems with exit interview)


| Level | General idea of work | 
| ----  | -------------------- | 
|  3    | High level of M/E grades on AI problems, High Pass portfolio | 
|  2    | Medium-high level of M/E grades on AI problems, Pass portfolio | 
|  1    | Medium level of M/E grades on AI problems and Pass portfolio | 

- Proof portfolio is just a collection of starred problems on which student got M or E, including some of certain type. Will include an exit interview to discuss. 
- Grades: 
  - High Pass: Preponderance of "E" grades on the items, good exit interview 
  - Pass: All M or higher grades, good exit interview 
- If not pass: C- maximum. 


## Engagement and community bundle 

- Daily prep
- Proof workshop
- Weekly reflections 

| Level | General idea of work | 
| ----  | -------------------- | 
|  3    | 90% of all possible points | 
|  2    | 80% of all possible points | 
|  1    | 70% of all possible points | 

Note: Mostly these cannot be redone. 

# Grades: 

| Grade | Foundational Skills | Application/Extension | Engagement/Community | 
|-------| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | 
|  A    | Level 3             | Level 3               | Level 3              | 
|  B    | Level 3             | Level 2               | Level 2              | 
|  C    | Level 2             | Level 2               | Level 2              |
|  D    | Level 1             | Level 1               | Level 1              | 

F given if anything fails to reach Level 1

Objectives: After successful completion of the course, students will be able toâ€¦

1. Write to communicate the topics of abstract algebra using accepted proof writing
conventions, explanations, and correct mathematical notation.

2. Identify fundamental structures of abstract algebra including rings, fields, and integral
domains.

3. Demonstrate problem solving skills in the context of abstract algebra topics through
consideration of examples, pattern exploration, conjecture, proof construction, and
generalization of results.

4. Analyze similarities and differences between algebraic structures including rings, fields, and
integral domains.

---


- Arrange the course into 10-12 modules
- Each module has a bundle consisting of: 
  - Definition activities
  - Theorem activities 
  - Problem set
    - Individual
      - Basic
      - Advanced (and "starred") 
    - Team
  - Proof workshop 
  - Weekly reflection 


Additional assessments: 
- Portfolio 
- Daily Prep 








  - Daily Prep exercises -- which include review, 
  - Problem Sets
    - Each *problem* graded EMRN; Problem *Set* grade is Pass/Not Yet based on number of M/E grades in each
    - Problems can be revised, up to two per week -- but not whole sets 
    - Split into individual and team 
      - Individual: Do individually with no outside help. Give several, pick a subset. 
      - Team: Work with your team then write up individually; I select a team member at random and grade it, whole group gets the same grade. 
    - Includes "star" problems which can be included in the portfolio at the end; these are always in the individual side.
  - Definition Activities 
    - All four steps of comprehending definitions -- include some review
  - Weekly reflections (videos on Flipgrid)
