# MTH 350 Winter 2021 Assessment planning

## Overall philosophy

- The course is more specs grading than SBG. We are looking at broad skills measured in bundles. 
- There are no tests or quizzes, what's the point? Not a lot of "skills" that benefit from a timed setting.
- SIMPLICITY 

BIG SKILLS: 

- Clear, correct mathematical expression in both written and oral form
-
