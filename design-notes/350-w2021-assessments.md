# MTH 350 Winter 2021 Assessment planning

## Overall philosophy

- The course is more specs grading than SBG. We are looking at broad skills measured in bundles. 
- There are no tests or quizzes, what's the point? Not a lot of "skills" that benefit from a timed setting.
- SIMPLICITY 

BIG SKILLS: 

- **Clear, correct mathematical expression in both written and oral form**
	- Given a proposition that is known to be true, write a proof 
	- Given a proposition that is known to be true, explain the proof in a presentation 
- **Ability to "unpack" mathematical definitions** 
	- State verbatim with all detais included
	- Construct simple and complex examples
	- Construct non-examples
	- Use the definition to rephrase information or to draw a conclusion from information 
- **Ability to "unpack" mathematical theorems and proofs** 
	- State verbatim
	- Rephrase using logic (esp negations) 
	- Use the definition to draw conclusions from data (or determine that the theorem doesn't apply)
	- Conduct a critical analysis of a proposed proof
	- Give a line-by-line explanation of proof 
	- (Not always applicable, but...) Convert the proof of a theorem into an algorithm and use it to compute something
- **Engage in productive mathematical reasoning** 
	- Decompose examples 
	- Recognize patterns
	- Phrase patterns into a clear and correct mathematical claim
	- Construct a proof or an algorithm for the claim 
- **"Big Picture" skills**
	- Articulate the connections between topics (*final exam or assignment*) 
	- Connect the course content to something meaningful to you (application, teaching, other areas of math) (*This sounds like a project*) 
	- Teaching yourself new things/self regulation/learning from feedback 

## How to assess progress/mastery on these? 

- Clear, correct mathematical expression: Problem sets, subset of which can be submitted for a portfolio and subset of those which are presented on FlipGrid; also basic problems that are just homework 
- "Unpacking": Also on Problem Sets but in a designated area (so there's unpacking activities, maybe basic problems, and "Starred" problems that are for portfolio and presentation) 
- Engaging in productive mathematical reasoning:  Workshop problems done asynchronously on Campuswire -- these would involve critical analysis of proofs, working with math phenomena with examples and so on 
- Project at the end to form connections -- involves video presentations and a product (brochure explainer, etc. ) 
- "Final exam" to include a portfolio of students' best work, how they self regulated and learned from feedback, how they connect up topics 

Summarizing: 
- Basic problems
- Starred problems -- or this could be a portfolio of starred problems to include x number of written problems and y number of video presentations 
- Workshop contributions 
- Project
- Final exam 

## Or back to the bundles idea 

Bundles: 
- Foundational skills (unpacking -- "basic" problems from problem sets + review work) 
- Portfolio (starred problems both written and oral) 
- Engagement and community (workshop contributions, daily prep, weekly reflections) 
- Project 

Problem sets -- Once per module and include basic and starred problems (so 12 of these) 

Workshop -- also once per module (12) 

Daily Prep -- once per meeting (24 ish) 

Weekly reflections -- every Friday we have significant meetings (12) 


Then the final exam which just contributes +/- 


## Grading the bundles 

Each bundle is graded on four levels: 0/1/2/3. Levels 2, 3 are considered "passing". Level
