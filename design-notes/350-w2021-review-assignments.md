### Conditional statements 

Blackboard quiz 

- Given a conditional statement, identify the hypothesis and conclusion. 
- Given a conditional statement, state its converse, contrapositive, and negation. 
- Given a conditional statement that is false, give a counterexample. 
- Given a conditional statement to prove, state the assumption and conclusion of a direct proof. 
- Given a conditional statement to prove, state the assumption and conclusion of a proof by contrapositive. 
- Given a conditional statement to prove, state the assumption and conclusion of a proof by contradiction. 

### Proof by induction

Blackboard quiz 

- State the definition of a *predicate* and differentiate between a predicate and a statement. 
- Given a predicate over the natural numbers, determine the truth value of the predicate at a specific number. 
- Given a proposition to prove that involves a predicate, state the three parts of the **framework** for a proof by mathematical induction: The base case, the inductive hypothesis, and the inductive step. 

### Set theory  

DONE

- Express a set of objects in both roster and set-builder notation, and convert between those two notations. 
- Find the intersection, union, and set difference of two sets; and find the complement of a single set. 
- Given two sets, determine whether one is a subset of the other; also determine if one is a proper subset of the other, and whether the two sets are equal. 
- State what it means for two sets to be *equal* in terms of subset inclusion. 
- Given a finite set, state its power set. 
- Determine the cardinality of a set. 
- Identify the major number systems (natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers) by their set symbol. 

### Functions

- Given a rule of association between two sets, determine if it is a function; if so, then state its domain, codomain, and range. 
- Given a function between two sets, find the image and preimage of various points. 
- Given a function between two sets, determine if it is injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), or bijective. 

### Matrices and complex numbers

- Given a matrix, state its size (e.g. $3 \times 4$). 
- Find the scalar multiple of a matrix. 
- Given two matrices of the appropriate size, compute their sum and their product. 
- Write the identity matrix of a given size. 
- Given a square matrix over the real numbers, determine if it is invertible. If it is, find its inverse. 
- Given a complex number, state its real and imaginary parts. 
- Given two complex numbers, find their sum, difference, and product. 
- Compute the reciprocal of a complex number; and given two complex numbers, divide them and express the quotient as another complex number.
