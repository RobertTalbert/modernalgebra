# Weekly Practice (template) -- MTH 350-01

## Instructions

- You may type up or handwrite your work, but **it must be neat, professional, and organized** and **it must be saved as a PDF file and uploaded to the appropriate Blackboard area**. Use a scanner or scanning app to convert handwritten work on paper to PDF. 
- **All tasks** below must have a complete solution that represents a good-faith attempt at being right. Mistakes are not penalized (although they may require a revision) but your work will be marked **P** or **X** if there are omissions (even accidental) or responses that are partial or guesses. 
- To abide by the class' academic honesty policy, your work must represent *your own understanding in your own words*. You may not use solutions, directly or indirectly, from any sources --- including other students, past students, online sources, or other textbooks.
