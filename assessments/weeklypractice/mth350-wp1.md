# Weekly Practice (template) -- MTH 350-01

## Instructions

- You may type up or handwrite your work, but **it must be neat, professional, and organized** and **it must be saved as a PDF file and uploaded to the appropriate Blackboard area**. Use a scanner or scanning app to convert handwritten work on paper to PDF. 
- **All tasks** below must have a complete solution that represents a good-faith attempt at being right. Mistakes are not penalized (although they may require a revision) but your work will be marked **P** or **X** if there are omissions (even accidental) or responses that are partial or guesses. 
- To abide by the class' academic honesty policy, your work must represent *your own understanding in your own words*. You may not use solutions, directly or indirectly, from any sources --- including other students, past students, online sources, or other textbooks. 

## Tasks 

1. Consider the following theorem: 

> **Theorem 1.10**: There do not exist nonzero integers $a,b$ such that $ab = 0$. 

This Theorem is logically equivalent to the following statement: 

> **Theorem 1.10 version 2**: For all integers $a,b$, if $ab = 0$ then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. 

(a) Now explain why Theorem 1.10 version 2 is logically equivalent to *this* statement: For all integers $a,b$, if $ab = 0$ and $a \neq 0$, then $b = 0$. (Hint: Symbolically, Theorem 1.10 version 2 has the form $P \rightarrow (Q \vee R)$. What form does this third statement have? Would a truth table help show the two statements are equivalent?)

(b) Since all three of these statements are equivalent, proving one of them proves all three. So, let's prove Theorem 1.10 by proving the third statement (from (b)). Here is a partial proof: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsdHifDjybjCKQ-6R8yPKZVK-DJPsNyfXOV4uH1-OY0/edit?usp=sharing   Some of the work has been left out; fill in the blanks and the missing parts to give a completed proof. There are two Lemmas there as well which should help --- be sure to read through the proofs of those
