# Daily Prep 1 -- MTH 350-01

## Overview 

We begin our study of Modern Algebra by going *way* back to the basics, and examining the fundamental rules of arithmetic with integers. In this lesson, we will review the *Axioms of Integer Arithmetic*, which are the basic properties of arithmetic we assume and then from this short list we will *prove* any other property of arithmetic we want to use. We'll similarly look at the *Ordering Axioms of the Integers* and use these four basic rules to prove results about integer inequalities. A particular focus is on creating meaningful definitions, in particular the definition of an *additive inverse* of an integer. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

- State the contents of the sets of natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers and identify these sets by their symbols.
- State the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic.
- State the definition of an additive inverse of an integer.
- State the Ordering Axioms of the integers.

**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

- Use the Axioms of Integer Arithmetic to prove basic results about integers (such as in Activity 1.6).
- Use the Ordering Axioms to prove basic results about integers (such as in Theorem 1.7).

## Resources for learning

**Reading:** Read through Investigation 1 (pp. 3--9) in the textbook.

## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
