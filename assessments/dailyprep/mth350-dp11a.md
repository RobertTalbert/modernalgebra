# Daily Prep 11A -- MTH 350-01

## Overview 

We've spent the last 3-4 weeks studying the concept of a ring, a fundamental algebraic structure that is found throughout mathematics and which formalizes much of the math we learned in high school. In this module we will look a little closer at the *structure* of a ring. In Module 11A we will see that there can be rings that live within larger rings; those are called **subrings**. In this module, we'll formally define this concept, develop a couple of tests to see if a subset of a ring is a subring, and look at some properties that subrings inherit and don't inherit from their parent rings. 


## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

+ State the definition of a *subring* of a ring.
+ Use the definition to decide if a specific subset of a specific ring is a subring of that ring; find examples of a subset of a ring that is *not* a subring. 
+ State which axioms of a ring are inherited by its subsets and which ones are not. 
+ State Theorem 9.4 (The *Subring Test*). 


**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Use Theorem 9.4 (the *Subring Test*) to decide if a specific subset of a specific ring is a subring of that ring. 
+ Determine what properties of a subring must be inherited from its parent ring, and give examples where inheritance fails. 

## Resources for learning

**Reading:** Read through Investigation 9 in the textbook starting with the section "Introduction" and through the statement of Theorem 9.4. Focus mainly on definition and theorem statements.

## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
