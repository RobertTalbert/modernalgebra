# Daily Prep 4B -- MTH 350-01

## Overview 

This lesson will give you your first strong taste of *abstraction*. We're going to attempt to create a definition of "prime" that works in *number systems other than the integers*. We first have to come to terms with what we mean by "number systems" and get examples of "other number systems". Then we will try to create an *abstract* definition of "prime" that captures the essence of prime numbers but does not require the underlying object to actually be a number. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

+ State the definition of the set of even integers and identify this set by its symbol. 
+ Identify the pros and cons of various definitions of a "prime number in $\mathbb{E}$"



**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Define what it means for a number to be "prime in $\mathbb{E}$". 
+ Give reasonable definitions of "prime" objects in number systems other than the integers (such as in Activity 4.10 and 4.11). 

## Resources for learning

Believe it or not there is **no reading and no video** this time. In fact **do not peek at the textbook** since it will spoil some of the activities we will do. There is just one definition to learn: 

:::info
**Definition:** The set of **even integers** is the set $\{\dots, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, \dots \} = \{ 2k \, : \, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. We denote this set $\mathbb{E}$.

## Submission and grading 

To submit your work, simply submit the Google Form. You will receive a receipt via email to confirm your submission. (Look in your spam folders if you do not see the receipt.) 

A **Pass** mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if each item on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a good faith effort to be right. **Mistakes are not penalized**. A **No Pass** is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
