Learning Objectives for MTH 410: Modern Algebra 2
=================================================

# How to read these objectives

+ Each section heading points to a different Investigation in the Hodge/Schlicker/Sundstrom book. The number of the investigation is included in the heading. 
+ Each section contains __Fundamentals__ and __Content__ objectives. __Fundamentals__ refer to definitions and mathematical results each student should be able to state and apply to basic tasks. __Content__ objectives refer to higher-level tasks to be performed using the Fundamentals. 
+ The following objectives are assumed to be in place for every investigation: 
    * State all definitions and mathematical results included in the list of Fundamentals. 
    * For all objects whose definitions are in the Fundamentals, construct examples and non-examples of those objects. 
    * For all computational items whose definitions are in the Fundamentals, calculate that item in a simple setting.  
    * Apply statements of mathematical results listed in the Fundamentals to simple cases. 
    * Explain the structure and strategy of the proof for each mathematical result listed in the Fundamentals. 

For example: 

+ In Investigation 20, the Fundamental terms are _group_, _abelian group_, _order_ of a group; and _unit_. You should be able to state the definitions for each of these. Additionally: 
    * _Group_, _Abelian group_, and _unit_ define __objects__. So you should be able to give examples of groups and examples of things that are not groups; examples of Abelian groups and examples of things that are not Abelian groups; and examples of units and examples of things that are not units. 
    * _Order_ refers to a computation, so if you are given a group, you should be able to compute its order.
