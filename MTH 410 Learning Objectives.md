Learning Objectives for MTH 410: Modern Algebra 2
===============================================

# Global learning outcomes

For every investigation in the book: 

+ State the definitions of all terms that are defined. 
+ State all mathematical results (Theorems, etc.) and know by name the ones that have names (e.g. Lagrange's Theorem). 
+ Write complete proofs for all results labelled "Theorem" and summarize the logic and structure of each proof. 

# Symmetry

+ Identify the symmetries of a regular polygon. 
+ Create or complete an operation table for symmetries of a figure. 

# An Introduction to Groups

+ Determine whether a set is closed under a binary operation. 
+ Give several examples of groups, both finite and infinite, by specifying the underlying set and the binary operation. 
+ Identify the identity element in a group. 
+ Given an element in a group, identify its inverse. 
+ Verify that a binary operation is associative (or show that it is not). 
+ Determine whether a group is Abelian. 
+ Determine whether a group has finite or infinite order. If finite, state the order of the group. 

# Integer Powers of Elements of a Group

+ Raise an element in a group to an integer power (possibly zero or negative). 
+ Use the properties of exponentiation proven in the investigation to manipulate powers of group elements. 

# Subgroups

+ Determine whether a subset of a group is a subgroup of that group by determining whether the group axioms hold. 
+ Determine whether a subset of a group is a subgroup of that group by using the Subgroup Test. 
+ Determine the center of a group. 
+ Determine the subgroup of a group that is generated by a single element $a$ (that is, the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$). 
+ Determine the order of an element in a group.
