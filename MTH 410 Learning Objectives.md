# Understanding these learning objectives

+ Concept Check (CC) objectives refer to basic information in the course: definitions and examples of terminology, important mathematical results, and basic computation. 
+ Module (M) objectives refer to more advanced concepts in the course, typically assessed by analysis and proof. 
+ Core Module (CORE-M) objectives are a subset of the M objectives that refer to the most important ideas in the course, which will be assessed in both timed and untimed settings. 

To "instantiate" a definition means to construct or state examples of that definition, and to create a non-example of that definition. 

Finally, note that not all of the mathematical results that you need to know are mentioned in the learning objectives -- only the ones that you need to be able to state (or complete) from memory. Please read the _entire_ Investigation to get a complete list of mathematical results.
