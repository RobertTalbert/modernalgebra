# MTH 350 Proof Portfolio guidelines 

## Purpose 

The purpose of the Proof Portfolio in MTH 350 is twofold: 

1. To isolate your best work on the hardest problems that you do in the course, and package it into a showcase for how much you have learned; and 
2. To reflect on what you've learned in the area of mathematical problem solving and make that thinking visible. 

The Proof Portfolio is not just another assignment; it's something you can carry with you once the course is over and show to employers, graduate schools, and others who might be interested in your problem-solving and learning skills. 

## What goes in the portfolio 

On each of our six Problem Sets, there is at least one and usually more than one **starred problem**. The Portfolio will consist of the following: 

- A collection of **eight starred problems** selected from the Problem Sets, that you consider to be your best work. You have free choice as to which problems are included, subject to two constraints: (1) *there must be at least one starred problem included from each Problem Set*, and (2) *no more than two starred problems from any given Problem Set may be included*. 
- The portfolio will also ask you to include some reflections on the work that you are including, especially regarding how you improved your work over time through the revision process and what you learned by doing so. Details on this added material will be given around week 9--10 of the semester. 

The entire package of your portfolio problems and the additional material will be submitted as a PDF on Blackboard, with a deadline of **11:59pm Eastern on Tuesday, April 27**. 

## How to put your portfolio together

You have six Problem Sets to do throughout the semester, due roughly every two weeks. Each one has at least one starred problem on it, and you will typically be asked to do just one starred problem per Problem Set. This means that six of the eight problems in the Portfolio will come simply from completing your normal work on Problem Sets. **To get *eight* problems in the Portfolio, you will need to choose two other starred problems that you *didn't* do as part of a Problem Set and work those out separately.** You have free choice as to which ones you do; only remember that you can pick no more than two problems from any given Problem Set. 

You will be evaluated and get feedback on the six problems that come from your Problem Set work, in the normal course of getting a mark on those Problem Sets. For the additional two problems, **you may submit your work on those to me (Talbert) at any time through email**, and I will evaluate them and give you constructive feedback and a mark of E, M, P, or X just like Problem Set problems; this mark does not count toward any grade, but is just for your information to get a sense of what you might need to improve on your work. There are no deadlines for completing those two additional problems other than the April 27 deadline. 


## How your portfolio will be evaluated 

As [mentioned in the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/HyqkgcE0P#How-do-I-earn-a-grade-in-the-course), Portfolios are marked **High Pass** **No Pass**, **Pass**, or **High Pass**. The criteria for each mark are as follows: 

| Mark | Criteria | 
| ---- | -------- | 
| **High Pass** | Each of the eight problems meets the standard for a mark of **M** on Problem Sets, and additionally at least four of the problems meet the standard for a mark of **E**. Finally the additional reflection material is well written. | 
| **Pass** | Each of the eight problems meets the standard for a mark of **M** on Problem Sets, and the additional reflection material is well written. | 
| **No Pass** | The requirements for **Pass** are not met. For example: there are fewer than eight problems submitted; or the reflection material is incomplete or poorly written; or at least one of the problems submitted does not meet the requirements for a mark of **M**. | 

Specific criteria for the additional reflection material (what constitutes "well written") will be given when that material is announced later. 

**How do I know if my work is good enough to Pass, or earn High Pass?** For the problems that you turned in as part of a Problem Set, you can look at the mark that the set earned: If you have earned a mark of **M** on a Problem Set, then every problem on that set is individually at least at "M" level; similarly if your entire Problem Set has earned an "E". However, if your Problem Set earned a mark of "M", it's possible that your starred problem is at "E" level; if you are considering including a starred problem from a set that earned "M" but you think the starred problem is better than an "M", let me know and I will evaluate it separately. As for the two additional problems, as mentioned above you can submit those at any time to get individual evaluation on those. 

## Questions

*Additions to this list might be made during the semester as they come up; watch this space for updates.* 

**What if I didn't turn in one or more of the Problem Sets?** If this is the case, you can still go back and do at least one and no more than two starred problems from each of the Problem Sets you did not submit. Just treat them like the two additional problems mentioned earlier; submit your work on them to me when you're ready to have it evaluated. 

**If I did a starred problem as part of a Problem Set submission, do I *have* to include it in the portfolio, or can I change my mind and do another one from that set instead for the Portfolio?** To keep things simple and to encourage you to stick with a problem once you've chosen to do it, the answer here is **no**. In other words, once you do a starred problem as part of a Problem Set that you turn in, you are committed to that problem for the semester, and it needs to go in your portfolio.
