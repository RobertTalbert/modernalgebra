# MTH 350-01: Calculus, Winter 2021

**Welcome to MTH 350**! I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, Professor of Mathematics, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this semester.

## What's MTH 350 all about? 

The algebra and arithmetic we learn in school are full of facts that students tend to accept without question. In MTH 350, we will **discover the real rules behind much of algebra**, and then try to see **how far we can bend the rules that we discover before they break**. 

MTH 350 takes on two big questions in mathematics: 

1. **How do arithmetic and algebra actually work?** For example, you probably know that every positive integer can be factored into a product of prime numbers, like $20 = 2 \times 2 \times 5$. But do you know *why* this is true, for *all* positive integers? 
2. **Can the rules of arithmetic and algebra be extended to mathematical objects that aren't necessarily numbers?** Take multiplication for example. We multiply numbers together, but we multiply things like matrices together too. How much of our rules for multiplication of *numbers*, work for *matrices*? Does matrix multiplication satisfy the commutative property, or the associative property? Can you "divide" matrices? Can we "factor" a matrix into a product of "prime" matrices? Is there even a sensible definition of these concepts? 

This twofold process of discovering the rules of how something works and then finding out where those rules can be applied, is called **abstraction**. Building strong skills in mathematical abstraction is perhaps the main goal of this course (which is sometimes called "abstract algebra"). 

The concepts in this course are also useful in the real world. For example, most modern cryptographic systems that protect your digital data are based on the math in MTH 350. And if you are a preservice teacher, you will come away from MTH 350 able to communicate to your future students not only what the rules of algebra *are*, but *why they work*. You'll have the opportunity to explore either of these applications and more as part of the course. 

**MTH 350 is a proof-based course.** A prerequisite for this course is MTH 210, and students are expected to enter MTH 350 with at least moderate fluency and skill in reading, analyzing, and writing mathematical proofs, and we will be engaging in these activities almost daily. You need to be comfortable with proof, and either skilled with writing proofs or open to improving your skills through persistent work in order to succeed in the course. If you are concerned about your preparation regarding proof, please contact me.

MTH 350 is challenging, made even moreso by the pandemic and the online format of the course. However please note that **my primary role in this course is to help you learn and succeed in the course**. Please call on me at any time (see below) if you have any needs whatsoever. 

**Prerequisites:** [MTH 210](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/2020-2021/course/mth-210.htm) and either [MTH 225](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/2020-2021/course/mth-225.htm) or [MTH 204](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/2020-2021/course/mth-204.htm).

## Key Information 

+ **Course mode:** This section of MTH 350 is **synchronous online**, which means we will meet online (through Zoom) at regularly scheduled times. Please note **I do not plan on being on campus this semester**. 
+ **Class meetings**: TR 11:30-12:45 online. Class sessions will be held on Zoom; the link and passcode are found on Blackboard in the *Syllabus and Calendar* area. You will need to sign in to Zoom to join the meetings. 
+ **Definition of a "week"**: For this class, a "week" runs from 12:01am Eastern time on Monday through 11:59pm Eastern time on the following Sunday. 
+ **Professor contact:** Email at talbertr@gvsu.edu, or direct-message me on Campuswire. If you have a question that the entire class might answer, please post it to the Class Feed on Campuswire instead of in a private message. 
+ **Professor availability:** I check messages regularly between the hours of 7:00am and 5:00pm on weekdays, and once on Saturdays; if you contact me during those hours and your message needs a reply, you can expect to receive one within a few hours, often sooner. *Outside of those hours, particularly on weekends, I am offline and not checking messages.* Please plan accordingly as you schedule your work. 
+ **Drop-in hours**: XXXXX on Campuswire (via Live Sesssions). You do *not* need an appointment for drop-in hours.
+ **Textbook**: _Abstract Algebra: An Inquiry-Based Approach_ by Hodge, Schlicker, and Sundstrom. 
+ **Course materials**: All course files, the class calendar, class forms, and most graded assignments are housed on Blackboard (http://mybb.gvsu.edu). 
+ **Course announcements and communication**: Course announcements, discussion, and other communication will be housed on **Campuswire** (link). You will also be able to opt in to a service called **Remind** which allows me to push reminders to you via text message. 

## What will class meetings be like? 

Your work in the class will follow a pattern that will involve you **before**, **during**, and **after** our meetings:

- **BEFORE each class**: You'll complete a **Daily Prep** assignment in which you'll read parts of the text, watch recorded lectures, and complete assignments that will get you up to speed on the basic ideas of new material. 
- **DURING each class**: Class time is reserved for *doing math*, together and individually. We will focus on activities that **apply the basics** that you learn in Daily Prep and get you ready for more advanced work later. 
- **AFTER each class**: You'll apply and extend the ideas we practice during class through different kinds of graded work. 

Since you learn math by *doing* math, class time will be prioritized for doing active work (both individually and in groups) on applications of basic concepts. You'll be expected to gain enough fluency on those basics to be productive in class, by doing your Daily Prep assignments. Lectures during class will be infrequent, short, and targeted at specific questions from your work rather than a general introduction to concepts. Also, **there are no timed tests or quizzes during class meetings**. 

## What assignments will there be? 

+ **Weekly Practice:** Homework sets given weekly that help you build the basic skills needed for understanding the course concepts. There are 12 of these planned. 
+ **Problem Sets:** Extended problem sets, mostly involving writing proofs. Some of these will be used in your Proof Portfolio (below). There are 6 of these planned. 
+ **Daily Prep:** Daily reading and (sometimes) videos, with exercises and questions to be submitted prior to class. These will help you learn the basics of new material and prepare you for higher-level focused work in class. There are 24 of these planned. 
+ **Proof Workshops:** Weekly discussion threads on Campuswire that will have you collaborate on detailed analyses of one or more written proofs. 
+ **Startup and Review Assignments:** Assignments done near the beginning of the course to get you setup and fluent with the course and the prerequisite mathematics, particularly from MTH 210. There are 6 of these planned. 

There are also two major assignments in the course that only happen once. More information on both of these will be given later in the semester: 

+ **Proof Portfolio:** A collection of your best proof-writing work, gathered from your Problem Sets. 
+ **Project:** You'll work individually or in a pair to explore a topic related to, but not necessarily covered in the course. Topics will be left up to you but can include research questions, applications to real-life problems, or applications of the course to K-12 teaching situations. The project will involve a written product as well as a "trailer" video and a brief presentation to the class (taking place during the last week of classes). 

We *do not* have a final exam in the course; however we will reserve the final exam time slot (April 27 from 10:00-11:50am) in case we need more time slots for project presentations. 


## How do I earn a grade in the course? 

Your grade in the course is earned by **accumulating and demonstrating evidence of skill on the main concepts in the course**. And this is done by completing the assignments outlined above, at a reasonably high level of quality. In our class, **there are no points or percentages** on most items. Instead, the work you turn in will be evaluated against **quality standards** that will be made clear on each assignment. If your work meets the standard, then you will receive full credit for it. Otherwise, you will get helpful feedback and, on most items, the chance to reflect on the feedback, revise your work, and then resubmit it for regrading. 

This feedback loop represents and supports the way that people learn: By trying things, making mistakes, reflecting on those mistakes, and then trying again. **You can make mistakes without penalty** as long as you *eventually* demonstrate evidence of skill. 

The individual types of assignments are marked as follows: 

| Assignment | How it's marked | 
| ---------- | --------------- | 
| Weekly Practice | E (Excellent), M (Meets Expectations), P (Progressing), or X (Not Assessable) | 
| Problem Sets | E (Excellent), M (Meets Expectations), P (Progressing), or X (Not Assessable) | 
| Daily Prep | **Pass** or **No Pass** | 
| Startup/Review Assignments | **Pass** or **No Pass** | 
| Proof Portfolio | **High Pass**, **Pass**, or **No Pass** | 
| Project | **High Pass**, **Pass**, or **No Pass** | 

The critera for the different marks are explained in the "xxxxxxx" section below. 

Your final grade in the course is determined by the following table. Each grade has a *requirement* specified in its row in the table. **To earn a grade, you will need to meet *all* the requirements in the row for that grade.** Put differently, your grade is the **highest** grade level for which **all** the requirements in a row of the table have been met or exceeded.

| Grade | Weekly Practice with M or E | Problem Sets with M or E | Daily Prep passed |  Startup/Review Assignments Passed | Proof Portfolo  and Project | 
| --- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| A | 10 | 5 | 20 | 6 | Pass on both, High Pass on one | 
| B | 9 | 4 | 18 | 6 | Pass on both | 
| C | 8 | 3 | 16 | 6 | Pass on Proof Portfolio | 
| D | 4 | 1 | 12 | n/a | Pass on one | 


A grade of F is given if **none** of the rows has been fully completed. 

**Plus/minus grades:** Plus/minus grades will be assigned at my discretion based on how close you are to the next higher or lower grade level.  

## How are individual assignments graded? 

+ **Weekly Practice** and **Problem Sets**: Each type has its own standards for "acceptable work" outlined in the XXX document. The grading process is outlined in the flowchart below: 
![EMPX rubric](https://i.ibb.co/0sRwsd6/EMPX-rubric-2021.png)
+ **Daily Prep**: A *Pass* mark is given if the Daily Prep is turned in before its deadline and if *each item* on the Daily Prep has a response that represents a *good faith effort to be right*. **Mistakes are not penalized**. In fact one purpose of Daily Preps is to provide me with information about issues that the class is having, prior to class meetings. A *No Pass* is given if an item is left blank (even accidentally), has an answer but it shows insufficient effort (including responses like "I don't know"), or if the Daily Prep is late.
+ **Startup/Review assignments**: The Pass/No Pass critera for these are specified on the individual assignments. 
+ **Proof Portfolio** and **Project**: The criteria for the different marks will be given in detail later in the semester. 

## How do I revise and resubmit my work? 

Instead of earning partial credit, on most assignments you will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your work based on feedback that I provide, if the work doesn't meet its standard for acceptability. This works as follows: 

+ **Weekly Practice**: Each Weekly Practice may be revised **once**. To revise, simply reflect on the feedback that's given, make corrections or rewrites to the original, and then upload the work again to Blackboard. 
+ **Problem Sets**: Each Problem Set may be revised **once per week**. To revise, simply reflect on the feedback that's given, make corrections or rewrites to the original, and then upload the work again to Blackboard. 
+ **Daily Prep** assignments *may not* be revised or resubmitted. They are graded on completeness and effort only, and therefore can only be done once. 
+ **Startup and Review Assignments**: The revision/reattempt policies for these will be specified on the individual assignments. 
+ **Proof portfolio:** This will be detailed later in the semester, but your portfolio will consist of work from your Problem Sets, so see the revision policies for those above. 
+ **Project:** The project may not be revised, but checkpoints for your work will be built into the project timeline, so you will have the chance to get feedback and make adjustments as you go. 

**Revisions of Weekly Practice or Problem Sets marked "X" cost one token** (see below). 


**Tokens:** Each student starts the semester with 5 **tokens**, which can be used to purchase exceptions to the course rules. The token "menu" is below. To spend a token, go to the *Token Spending* form (found in the in the *Submit a Form* area on Blackboard), fill it out, and submit it. Once the form is submitted, the item you purchased is yours; you do not need permission or confirmation. Everything listed here costs 1 token: 

+ Revise a Weekly Practice a second time. (Third, fourth, etc. revisions of a single Weekly Practice are not allowed.)
+ Revise a second Problem Set in a given week. (Third, fourth, etc. revisions of a single Problem Set in a week are not allowed.)
+ Extend any deadline *except for Daily Prep* by 12 hours. 
+ Revise a Weekly Practice or Problem Set marked "X". 
+ Convert a "No Pass" on a Daily Prep to a "Pass". 

## What else do I need to know? (Additional course policies) 

### Attendance and deadlines

**Attendance:** You will need to participate actively in each class meeting to get the most out of the course and avoid having to teach yourself the material. Attendance will be taken but not graded; I will follow up with students with excessive absences, but no direct penalty is incurred. You do not need to seek permission to miss a class. However, realize that excessive absences will severely limit your ability to learn the subject. 

**Deadlines and late work:** Deadlines are generally strictly enforced, and late work will not be accepted. However, you can spend tokens to extend deadlines. Daily Prep deadlines cannot be extended, but you can spend a token to change a Daily Prep grade to Pass. 

### Collaboration and academic honesty

I highly encourage you to collaborate with your classmates whenever collaboration is allowed. However, realize that *collaboration is not always allowed* and in all cases, there are limitations on how you can collaborate. In particular: 

- On **Weekly Practices** and **Problem Sets**, your work must represent *your own understanding* in *your own words*. You may not use solutions, directly or indirectly, from any sources --- including other students, past students, online sources, or other textbooks. 
- On **all other assignments**, you may collaborate with others, but you must contribute significantly to the assignment, and your work must represent *your own understanding* in *your own words*.

You are responsible for understanding this policy and the [GVSU Student Code](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/policy.htm?policyId=EFAB64E1-C25B-E1A3-CA2B08B0B821C774&search=). Violations will result, at minimum, in a mark of "X" or "No Pass" on the assignment. Serious or repeat violations of this policy will result in increasingly horrible consequences, including being barred from further submissions of the assignment, or even failure of the class. 

### Technology 

Being an online class, we will use a variety of technological tools to learn. 

- You *do not* need a graphing calculator, and we will not use them in the class, but it's OK if you have one. (We will use [Desmos](http://www.desmos.com), a free online graphing tool, instead of graphing calculators.)
- Instead, you *do need* a **laptop or tablet device** running a **modern web browser** (such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) and **reliable access to high-speed internet**. 
- You also need an **active GVSU network account** so you can access email, Blackboard, and Google Docs. 
- Preferably, your device should have a **touchscreen** that allows **writing on the screen with a stylus**. If you don't have such a device, consider purchasing a [drawing pad](https://www.amazon.com/customerpicks/Explore-drawing-tablets-for-laptops/424f9b9ace2bfffcb82c) that connects your computer via USB; many are under $50. 
- The software tools we use in the course are all free and either web-based or available as apps on mutiple platforms. We will introduce and train on these in the first week of classes. 

If you encounter issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help: 

+ *For help with Blackboard*: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/. 
+ *For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing*: Email the GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/. 
+ *For specific help with your computer*: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or computer store. 
+ *For help with course tools such as Campuswire*: Ask a question on the `#tech` channel on Campuswire, seek out the help documentation in the tool, or do a targeted Google search. 

Please note that **I (Prof. Talbert) am not able to provide student tech support** as I do not have access to your accounts or knowledge of your hardware. I can help with questions about course tools (Desmos, etc.) but please ask those questions on Campuswire so others can see and help too. 


### Getting help and support 

**Special learning needs:** If you have special needs because of learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616-331-2490 or http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ . DSR will help you arrange accommodations.  Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

**Basic needs security:** If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit [Replenish](https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/), a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources. 

**Gender identity and expression:** If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request.  The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

### Credits

I borrowed a lot from the MTH 201 syllabus of Prof. David Clark.
