+ An [inverted classroom design ](http://invertedclassroom.wikispaces.com/)in which students encounter basic concepts prior to class in order to have extended class time for creative application and conceptual work.
+ The use of [specifications grading](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598) to provide a competency-based means of assessing student work.

The professor of record for the course is Robert Talbert. Please contact on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert), [Google+](http://google.com/+RobertTalbert), or email at [talbertr@gvsu.edu](talbertr@gvsu.edu).
